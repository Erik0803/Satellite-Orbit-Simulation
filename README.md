# Satellite-Orbit-Simulation
This is a 3D satellite orbit simulation. Users can set altitude and velocity to visualize trajectories, velocity vectors, and orbital data like speed, period, and energy. It updates motion with gravitational physics, detects collisions, and provides interactive controls for launching, resetting, and exploring orbital mechanics.
